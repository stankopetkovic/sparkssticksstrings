            was the result of a theatre workshop with young people led
            by Kristian Al Droubi and Sanja Cekov. It was performed at
            the "Face to Face" Street Art Festival in Kraljevo, Serbia
            in 2007. The workshop was an invitation for young people
            who are often forced to live in the fringe of society to
            express their thoughts and feelings and face the society
            with their needs.

            was a socially-engaged performance, serving as a mirror of
            the political stagnation and apathy in the society. It was
            performed in July 2007, on Infantfusion Festival (INFANT:
            International Festival of Alternative and New Theatre) at
            the Cultural Centre of Novi Sad, Serbia.

            was performed in 2007, as part of the Infantfusion Festival
            (INFANT). The performance was based on the idea that every
            person, space or event has its own secrets. The performance
            started on a public square with the auction of the
            performers' personal secrets and their revealing through
            performance, after which the performers took the audience
            to the riverbank. Using the boat the spectators were taken
            to one of the city's secret places - the underground
            passage of Petrovaradin Fortress, where a Butoh dancer and
            a photo exhibition revealed the secrets of INFANT Festival.

            was performed on FACE (Festival of Alternative Cultural
            Exchange) in 2005 in Novi Sad, Serbia. It was a
            mosaic-performance made of 19 different performance pieces.
            It was set in a hotel room and it lasted for more than 10
            hours. Each performance piece was performed for only one
            visitor who was entangled into the creative process and
            became performer himself/herself.

            Through living and creating with the young people from all
            countries that were part of SFR Yugoslavia, we came to the
            conclusion that all of us have the same questions and no
            answers to them. "The R/Evolution" tells the story of SFR
            Yugoslavia's falling apart using an old Yugoslav car which
            was painted with the six present national flags of former
            Yugoslav republics before it was finally cut into pieces.
